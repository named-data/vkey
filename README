Key Verification Library

This library verifies the signature of a ccnx packet.
It assumes a trust management system it already working (e.g. mkey).

It manages a trusted key database and a trusted key cache for each application.
If a key is not find in database and the cache, it's going to be fetched in 
ccnx way.

A root key is public knowledge. For simplicity, the code hard code the 
root key for ndn test bed.

To compile:
./waf configure
./waf

If you want to run unit tests:
1. start ccnd and ccnr
2. ./waf configure --with-debug --with-test
   ./waf
3. build/unittests
